parseurl-ie9
============

Demo the behavior of anchor URL parsing in IE9.

## Using this Demo
Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Fire up grunt connect. You will probably have to do this through `sudo` because the server must be running on port 80:

```sh
sudo grunt connect
```

Load index.html in IE9 and some other browser. Note that in IE9, the hostname property has `:80` appended.
